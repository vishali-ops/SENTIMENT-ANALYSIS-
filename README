This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system that classifies user-given text into Positive or Negative sentiment. If a positive sentence is provided, the model predicts Positive, and if a negative sentence is provided, the model predicts Negative. This task helps in understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and how machine learning models can analyze emotions from text.
